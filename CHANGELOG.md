## [0.38.5]

The panel's layout, its streaming path, and its interactivity under load. No wire-format or
settings change: a `0.38.4` bridge and a `0.38.5` extension interoperate exactly as before.

### Fixed

- **The side panel could open blank while its header and composer drew normally.** `.app` and
  `.sheet` are CSS grids that pinned their *row* axis with a deliberate `minmax(0, 1fr)` guard
  and never pinned their *column* axis. With no `grid-template-columns`, the implicit `auto`
  column is sized to its items' max-content, so a single long unbreakable tool summary — a URL,
  or a run of text with no spaces, exactly what a failed `browser_navigate` produces — stretched
  the column to ~2346px inside a 360px panel. `body { overflow-x: hidden }` then clipped the
  content off the right edge. Both grids now declare `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)`.
- **The reading cap was written through instead of clamped.** `--panel-max` comes from
  `settings.readWidth` (default 640), and it was applied verbatim, so a 360px panel laid every
  text column out 640px wide inside a 360px box — a second, independent way to produce the
  blank panel above. It is now clamped to the panel's own width, applied *before* the first
  paint rather than only when the first state push arrived (a panel that never received one kept
  the stylesheet default of 640), and re-applied by a `ResizeObserver` when the panel is dragged.
- **A long reply could freeze the panel, because the streaming fast path was never reached.**
  The worker creates a durable `assistant` row on the first delta and keeps it `running`, and
  that row arrives in `state.timeline`; the panel only treated its own synthetic row as
  streaming, so `.msg--streaming` never existed, every repaint fell back to a full transcript
  rebuild, and the partial reply was rendered as finished Markdown on every frame — the
  quadratic path the streaming mode exists to avoid. A `running` assistant row is now the
  streaming target, and the repaint updates that bubble in place.
- **Streaming rendered Markdown per frame.** While `streaming` is true the reply is plain text
  again, which is what the README always claimed; Markdown is rendered once, when the turn ends.
  Repaints are coalesced to one per animation frame.
- **Every state push destroyed the composer, so typing during a reply was lost.** `turn/start`,
  `turn/end` and each `state` push called the full `render()`, which replaced the textarea and
  dropped focus. A 100-round simulation measured 240 lost focus events and 240 swallowed
  keystrokes in 20 rounds; it now measures zero in 100. Turn boundaries repaint the header,
  transcript, send/stop button and meta line; state pushes also refresh the settings sheet in
  place, so its badge updates without rebuilding it.
- **Sending a prompt or stopping a run also destroyed the composer.** The four paths the reader
  drives themselves — `runPrompt`, `runCommand`, `runOpen` and `stopRun` — still called the full
  `render()`. Pressing Enter removed the box the draft was in, and the *next* message was
  discarded when the worker answered. They repaint in place now.
- **The send button could stay a stop button after the turn ended.** The turn flag arrives in
  `state` as well as in `session.event`, and only the event path refreshed the button. A state
  push now refreshes it too, which also clears a stale "not connected" line from the meta row
  once the bridge is back.
- **The conversation picker could latch on 「正在读取…」 with no way out.** `refreshSettingsSheet`
  skips work when nothing it draws has changed, and its change check omitted the fetched
  conversation list — so the reply to `session.list` was swallowed, the options were never
  inserted, and a `<select>` holding only its placeholder never fires `change`. The check now
  covers the list, its loading flag and the pinned id.
- **Switching conversation painted the previous one's half-written reply into the new one.**
  The in-flight reply text was never cleared when `state.session.id` changed, so the abandoned
  answer kept rendering — with a blinking caret — inside the conversation just opened.
- **A full repaint always scrolled to the bottom.** `pinnedScroll` was initialised to `true`,
  read once, and never set back — a constant dressed as state — so all twenty-odd `render()`
  call sites yanked a reader who had scrolled up. The position is now captured before the rebuild
  and restored after.
- **The conversation picker latched on "loading" forever.** `requestSessions()` set
  `sessionsLoading` before the call and its `catch` did nothing, so a dead port left the guard
  blocking every retry for the life of the panel. `call()` also had no timeout and `dispose()`
  never settled in-flight requests, so a lost answer meant a promise that never resolved — and a
  send button that stayed disabled.
- **A rebuilt transcript re-parsed Markdown for every reply on screen.** Rendering is pure, so
  results are cached. The cache is bounded at the timeline's own size (200 entries) and evicts
  least-recently-used, because a smaller cache misses for half of a long conversation and an
  insertion-ordered one lets the replies on screen age out first.
- **Light-mode contrast.** `--text-tertiary` measured 3.71:1 on white and 3.48:1 on `--bg-subtle`
  while being used as text at 11-13px in a dozen places; it is now 4.93:1.
- **The conversation picker could not shrink**, so a long desktop conversation title pushed the
  control past the panel edge where `overflow-x: hidden` clipped it — a dropdown whose arrow was
  unreachable. `prefers-reduced-motion` also left the caret blinking, because shortening an
  animation's duration does not stop an `infinite` one.
- **The settings button could be clipped away in a narrow panel.** The header's action row was
  `flex: none` and its buttons do not wrap, so with a lost tab binding the row grew past the
  panel and `overflow-x: hidden` removed its rightmost control — the panel's only route to its
  own settings. The row shrinks and its text buttons ellipsise.
- **The half-written-directive hint had no style at all**, so it rendered in the body text colour
  and read as a statement rather than a reminder.

### Changed

- Streaming updates from the worker to the panel are coalesced to at most one per 50 ms. Each one
  clones the assistant's whole text and posts it across the port, so notifying per delta was both
  wasteful and quadratic in the reply length.
- `benchmark/package.json` is now covered by the version-agreement test. It was the one package a
  version bump could quietly leave behind.

### Added

- A 100-round panel simulation that drives the panel the way the desktop app does — deltas, state
  pushes, typing, clicks — and reports per-round outcomes, so an intermittent fault cannot pass as
  a success.
- A nine-step user journey that walks one session end to end and asserts at every step that the
  content is on screen and the controls still respond. It catches the failures that happen
  *between* steps, which is where every one of the above was found.
- Regression tests for the grid axes, the reading cap at nine panel widths, the drawing cache, the
  streaming branch, and the send/stop button.

## [0.38.4]

This release is the 「工作区内」 feature line in full, plus the pass that made it cheap
enough to ship. `0.38.3` was published before any of it existed, so nothing here changes
what that version does; it is a new number because the bridge gained a method and the
extension gained a mode.

### Changed

- **The shipped defaults changed, so a fresh install behaves differently.** Three
  settings now start where this project's own configuration ended up after living with
  the extension:
  - `unrestrictedBrowserAccess: true` — a new install answers no approval prompt for the
    browser tools; clicking, typing and closing tabs proceed. It also overrides
    `sharePageContent`, forcing it to `auto` at the point the dispatch mode is resolved,
    so it takes precedence over a user who chose to be asked before a page is read. The
    strip spells the trade out and turns it off, and the switch is per-record, so a user
    who turns it off keeps it off.
  - `sessionScope: 'workspace'` — the panel mirrors the desktop's browser workspace
    instead of starting a conversation of its own.
  - `tabSwitch: 'follow'` — the model follows the tab the user moved to rather than
    interrupting to ask.
  - **Upgrading users are not silently switched.** Their stored record is read before the
    bridge connects (`settingsReady` gates `startBridge`), so an existing choice — including
    `unrestrictedBrowserAccess: false` — is what applies. Only a record that says nothing
    about a field inherits the new default, which is the case for a genuinely fresh
    install.
  - Normalisation for `unrestrictedBrowserAccess` and `sessionScope` was also wrong in a
    way that would have hidden this: both fell back to a hard-coded literal rather than to
    `SETTINGS_DEFAULTS`, so changing the default had no effect on the normalised result.
    Both now reference the default, and `unrestrictedBrowserAccess` keeps a real `false`
    instead of collapsing every unreadable value to `false`.

### Added

- **「工作区内」: the panel mirrors a whole workspace, so nothing has to be picked in
  advance.** The other two modes mirror exactly one conversation, which meant an
  instruction issued on the desktop was only visible here if that conversation had been
  chosen beforehand — and choosing it was the hard part, because the desktop publishes
  no "session I am looking at" signal. The third option reads the desktop's browser
  workspace and follows *every* conversation in it, so work started on the desktop side
  appears on its own.
  - The group is identified by the **path** the bridge names in the handshake
    (`policy.sessionWorkspacePath`), not by its title: a user may rename 「浏览器对话」,
    and a path is what the desktop keeps stable. Absent when the grouping is switched
    off, which is exactly when the mode has nothing to mirror.
  - A follower is opened per conversation, because the bridge streams nothing until
    someone asks and the panel never prompts most of them.
  - Timeline rows carry the conversation they came from, so several mirrored transcripts
    do not interleave into one unreadable column. Leaving the mode, or a conversation
    leaving the group, drops only the affected rows.
  - Prompts still go to the panel's own conversation. Mirroring is about watching what
    the desktop drives; writing into a mirrored conversation is a different feature and
    is deliberately not part of this.
  - **In its steady state it follows only the conversations that are actually live.**
    Following every member of a workspace costs one server-side stream per member to
    watch the one or two producing something, and a group grows as conversations
    accumulate. There is no poll-free signal to use instead — `workspace/follow` pushes
    only its baseline and a workspace's own `updatedAt` moves on membership rather than
    activity — so the mode reads cheap metadata: `updatedAt` moves when a conversation
    produces an event and stays put when it does not, and `running` marks a turn in
    flight. A conversation that starts working is followed on the next tick; one that
    goes quiet is dropped. A turn in flight is kept however long ago it last emitted, so
    a slow turn is not dropped halfway through. Entering the mode still mirrors the whole
    group once, which is what brings an existing transcript on screen.
- **The bridge can follow several Sessions at once**, which the mode above needs. It
  kept a single follower per connection and opening a new one aborted the previous, so
  asking for nineteen conversations left exactly one streaming while the panel looked
  like it was working. Followers are now keyed by Session, each with its own abort
  controller and its own notion of being current; the shared generation counter that
  decided "am I still wanted?" is gone too, because a counter shared by the whole
  connection made every *other* Session look replaced the moment a new one was followed
  — the same failure reached a different way. Re-asking for a Session already followed
  is a no-op, which matters because the extension asks on every refresh tick.
- **`session.unfollow`, so streams are released when the mirror shrinks.** It takes the
  set still being watched rather than the set to close: the extension's mirror is the
  authority, so a bridge that missed an earlier change still converges on exactly the
  streams wanted, and naming a conversation that is not followed is a no-op. Without it,
  leaving the mode left the bridge reading every conversation it had ever opened until
  the connection ended. The extension posts it best-effort and swallows a failure, since
  the two halves upgrade separately — an older bridge answers with an error and the only
  consequence is that streams are held a little longer.
- **A Chrome Web Store install connects with no configuration.** `extensionId` now takes
  a comma-separated list of ids (`DEFAULT_EXTENSION_IDS`), defaulting to this
  repository's development id and `agipnijjkpomaannkjkjliggoffdiaf`, the id the Chrome
  Web Store assigned. One build genuinely has two possible ids, because the store
  refuses a manifest carrying `key` and then assigns its own. Matching stays exact per
  entry — an unlisted id, a *prefix* of a listed one, another scheme, and an empty
  configuration are all refused.

### Fixed

- **`browser_launch` claimed a windowless browser was running.** A Chromium process
  outlives its last window and the extension keeps its socket open while it does, so
  "a connection exists" said nothing about whether there was a page to act on. The tool
  answered "already running and connected" to someone looking at no browser at all, and
  every page tool then failed with "no active tab". `launchBrowser` had the same blind
  spot in its own early return. The bridge now asks the window manager (PowerShell
  `MainWindowHandle` on Windows, System Events on macOS) how many windows the running
  browsers own, and acts only on a **definite** "none": an unsupported platform, a shell
  that will not run, and a probe that throws all degrade to "unknown", because a wrong
  `false` opens a browser window nobody asked for.
- **A prompt could be delivered to the conversation the user had just left.** Creating or
  restoring a conversation is a round trip, and picking another one during it correctly
  stopped the *adoption* — but the resolved id was still handed to `sessionRpc.prompt`.
  The binding is now re-checked after the await and the send is refused with a sentence
  that says to send it again.
- **A refused `browser_type` wrote the typed value into the activity list.** The refusal
  quotes the value it could not match, which put a password or a token into
  `ControlState.activity` and the timeline — the two places `activity.ts` promises never
  to echo typed text. The reason is kept and the value is replaced by its length.
- **A duplicate `tool.call` id could hang the revocation barrier forever.** A second
  frame with an id already in the map replaced the entry, and the replaced call's
  close-out then returned early — so its one-shot `settle()` never fired and
  `cancelAllToolCalls()` could no longer reach it. `settled` is what
  `revokeUnrestrictedAccess()` awaits, so "unrestricted access = off" cleared in memory
  but never reached `storage.local`, and an MV3 restart restored it.
- **A cancelled image-recognition call still uploaded the image.** The relay path sent
  `image.call` without checking the abort signal first, so a call cancelled while queued
  behind another image was dispatched anyway — the user's image sent for an answer
  nobody was waiting for, and billed.
- **A failed `session.follow` was the one failure with no surface.** The panel stayed
  correctly bound, received nothing, and looked exactly like a conversation with nothing
  in it — which is what a desktop app running an older bridge produces. The worker now
  turns that specific failure into a panel notice naming the fix, and clears it once a
  follow succeeds or the connection changes.
- **The conversation picker was unreadable, and two field bugs caused it.** `listSessions`
  read `item.title`, which does not exist — the desktop nests it at
  `projections.values.title` — so every conversation was labelled "Untitled". A fifth of
  the list was not conversations at all: every delegated sub-agent is a Session of its
  own, so the picker filled with rows called "You are a senior code reviewer", now
  filtered on `origin`/`parentSessionId`. And it now shows the opening prompt, which is
  the fact that actually distinguishes two conversations whose titles collide by design.
- **Two hooks that were written and never called, and were real gaps rather than
  tidiness.** A relay recognition in flight could not be settled when the socket
  dropped, so it waited out its full timeout; an approval the user could no longer answer
  stayed open, because losing the connection closes the control strip and the decision
  then has nowhere to come from.

## [0.38.3]

No code shipped as this version. It was incremented while the 「工作区内」 work was in
progress, and that work was released as `0.38.4` instead, so this entry records only why
the number was taken: **npm retires version numbers two different ways, and this package
has hit both.**

- `0.38.0` was published and then unpublished. npm permanently retires a version that has
  been unpublished, so it can never be published again.
- `0.38.1` was accepted by `pnpm publish`, which stages a package and waits to be told to
  promote it. The promotion never happened, and the registry now refuses to publish over a
  staged version.
- `0.38.2` was published with `npm publish`, which writes directly and does not stage. It
  is the version `latest` pointed at until `0.38.4`.
## [0.38.2]

No code changed. Only the version number, for a reason worth writing down: **npm
retires version numbers two different ways, and this package has now hit both.**

- `0.38.0` was published on 2026-10-06 and unpublished 23 minutes later. npm
  permanently retires a version that has been unpublished, so it can never be
  published again.
- `0.38.1` was accepted by `pnpm publish`, which stages a package and waits to be
  told to promote it. The promotion never happened, and the registry now refuses
  that version with `409 Cannot publish over previously staged version "0.38.1"` —
  a marker that survives the staged record being emptied (`pnpm stage list` reports
  nothing).

`0.38.2` is the first version number on this package name with no history behind
it. Until now the registry has also been carrying a `0.0.0-stage` placeholder as
`latest`, which is what a client would have downloaded; a normal publish replaces
it as `latest`.

Publish with `npm publish`, not `pnpm publish`: npm writes the version directly
and does not stage it, so there is nothing left to promote.

## [0.38.1]

A naming and wording release. No behaviour changed.

### Changed

- **The extension is called `dsh 浏览器扩展（全端）`** (`dsh 瀏覽器擴充功能（全端）`
  in Traditional Chinese). The parenthetical said `应用端` — the *application* side —
  which described only one end of a product that has several. The English name,
  `dsh Browser Extension`, already carried no such limit and is unchanged.
- **The short description now says which model reads a picture.** The Chinese version
  ended at "会把你要看的那张图交给桌面端", which reads as though the desktop app looks
  at the image itself; the picture is handed to the model configured there, so it now
  says so. The English version was reworded to match (`Image look-up is optional` →
  `Image look-up optional`) and is **122 characters** against the store's 132 limit —
  short enough that naming the model there as well would have pushed it over, which is
  why the detailed description carries that detail instead. The store listing, the
  paste-in sheet and the submission form were kept byte-equal to `_locales/en`, which
  `extension/tests/locales.spec.ts` asserts.
- **`0.38.0` was never published to npm and cannot be**: the name
  `dsh-browser-crossplatform` was registered on 2026-10-06 and unpublished 23 minutes
  later, and npm permanently retires a version number that has been unpublished. This
  release therefore takes `0.38.1`, and every version-holding file moved with it.

## [0.38]

A correctness and truthfulness pass over 0.37: one security boundary narrowed,
a browser that is closed can now be started by the desktop, several claims in the
documentation brought back in line with the code, and the release tooling made to
produce what the stores actually accept.

### Added

- **A task list the user can watch.** A request that needs several browser steps was
  previously visible only as a stream of tool calls: the reader could see each step
  but not the job they belonged to, and a finished step looked exactly like a
  pending one — the same request apparently repeating. Now the model opens such a
  turn by writing the checklist it is about to execute and re-emits it with the
  boxes ticked as it goes, and the panel renders that checklist above the run with
  the task in progress, the finished ones and the failed ones marked.
  - The format is a plain markdown checkbox list (`- [ ]`, `- [>]`, `- [x]`, `- [!]`),
    declared to the model in the bridge's system-prompt section and parsed by
    `packages/protocol/src/plan.ts`, so the wording the model is given and the shape
    the panel reads cannot drift.
  - The rule lives inside the prompt's existing ASCII-only section, so the
    homoglyph assertion in `packages/bridge/tests/index.spec.ts` covers it too.
  - A streaming update never shrinks the list: the model rewrites the checklist
    while it is still arriving, so the panel keeps the more complete of the two
    versions (`preferPlan`) instead of truncating the list on every tick.
  - A plan written without boxes is still recognised, but only under a heading that
    announces one, so an ordinary bulleted answer is not mistaken for a task list.
- **The activity line now carries the outcome, not just the attempt.** Every
  successful row used to read `browser_navigate https://www.bilibili.com` — what was
  asked for, with nothing about whether it happened, so a completed step was
  indistinguishable from one that never ran. Rows now end with the tool's own
  one-line answer (`✓ Opened a new tab at …`), `browser_list_tabs` reports how many
  tabs it listed, and the URL in the request part is still reduced to its origin so
  paths and query terms do not accumulate in the list.
- **`browser_launch`, and a preflight on every browser tool.** Tool execution lives
  in the extension, so a closed browser left the model with a bare `bridge-closed`
  error and no way out. A call with no connection now tries to start the browser
  first and reports what actually happened.
  - It launches **the browser the user already uses** — the executable comes from
    the system's default-browser record — with **no extra flags at all**: no
    `--user-data-dir` (that would be a second browser, with none of the user's tabs
    or logins) and no `--load-extension`.
  - If that browser is **already running, nothing is launched**: a second start only
    hands the request to the existing process and discards the flags, so the answer
    names the browser to enable the extension in rather than opening a dead window.
  - It also checks whether the extension is installed in any Chrome/Edge/Brave/
    Chromium profile and says which situation applies, because a launch cannot
    install anything: an unpacked `--load-extension` lasts one session and is gone
    at the next start (verified), and since Chrome 137 branded Chrome/Edge builds
    ignore the flag entirely (Chromium and Chrome-for-Testing still honour it).
  - Gated by `openPagesForUser`, the switch that already decides whether the model
    may drive the browser to new places. `browserUserDataDir`, `extensionPath` and
    `browserHeadless` cover the development case, a named profile that genuinely
    loads an unpacked build.
  - **The dead end is closed explicitly.** Being told "install the extension" with
    no destination is what left users stuck, so the answer now carries the browser's
    own extensions page (`chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`) and the
    bridge **opens that page** at the moment it has established the extension is
    installed nowhere — the only situation with no automatic way out. Opening it
    goes through the OS handler (`cmd start` / `open` / `xdg-open`), so it lands in
    whichever browser the user actually uses, Firefox included. `docs/INSTALL.md`
    and its Chinese twin now lead with "install the extension first, in the browser
    you actually use" and gained a "the browser was closed and the model could not
    open it" entry; the troubleshooting skill gained the same two checks.

### Security

- **The token-free loopback path is now bound to one named extension.** It used to
  accept any upgrade whose `Origin` merely started with `chrome-extension://` —
  and every other extension installed in the same browser presents one of those,
  so any of them (or a local process that simply sets the header) could reach the
  full browser tool surface without the token. The check is now an exact match
  against the configured `extensionId`, whose default is the id this repository's
  manifest `key` derives (`kdhkdgfcinfkmogifamoapmheihhcjfk`). Set
  `extensionId: ''` to require the token on every connection, loopback included.
  `docs/TRUST-MODEL.md` states the residual exposure plainly: a process that knows
  the id can still forge the header.

### Fixed

- **Copy that contradicted the code, found in a pre-release pass over every
  user-facing string.** Each of these made the product describe something other
  than what it does:
  - The store listing claimed "no dashboards, no progress bars" while the panel now
    renders the per-turn task list with a `{done}/{total}` counter. Both languages
    were corrected in `store-assets/store-listing.md` and its paste-in twin.
  - `plan.progress` counted **failed** tasks as completed (`{done}` received
    `done + failed`), so a 3-pass/2-fail checklist read "5/5 已完成" beside two rows
    marked `✕`. Only finished tasks count now.
  - The settings row read "AI 能打开网页" / "AI can open web pages" next to a badge
    that reports the *handshake*, which could read as "this feature is off" — in a
    store review, as a permission the extension does not have. The label now names
    the desktop as the side that decides.
  - `visionTierHelp` (EN) promised "every image looked at is one request", which the
    24-hour description memo and per-identity de-duplication contradict; both
    languages now state the cost, what leaves the machine, and that a repeat
    question is answered from the memo.
  - Five copy keys that nothing rendered were removed from both languages
    (`common.working`, `composer.commandBadge`, `composer.askBadge`,
    `composer.unavailable`, `approval.origins`).
  - `store-assets/permission-and-data-disclosure.md` now says what the relay sends
    when the extension's own image fetch fails: the image's address, not its bytes.

- **The end-to-end suite was passing without running.** It drove the system
  Chrome, which since 137 ignores `--load-extension`, and a missing browser made
  the suite *skip* — a green that proved nothing. CI now installs Playwright's own
  Chromium (via `benchmark/lib/browser-install.mjs`, which resolves the CLI
  through Node instead of a shell) and the resolver
  `benchmark/lib/chromium-path.mjs` asks `playwright-core` which revision to load,
  so the path cannot drift. The e2e also binds whichever discovery port is free
  rather than 3080 specifically, because a leftover socket used to surface as a
  60-second "no connection" failure that said nothing about the cause.
- **`Compress-Archive` was wrong for a store upload.** It writes `\` entry names,
  which the stores reject, and the publishing notes only warned about Windows
  "send to → compressed folder". Both archives are now produced by
  `extension/scripts/package.mjs`: a dependency-free ZIP writer that always emits
  `/`, refuses a backslash entry, and names each archive after the version in the
  manifest inside it.
- **`extension/scripts/build.mjs` no longer passes `shell: true` with an argument
  list** (Node 24 deprecates it, DEP0190); the Windows `.cmd` shim is named
  explicitly instead, so watch and build behave the same on every platform.
- **`README.md` and its Chinese twin described a design the code does not have.**
  The manifests still declare global `content_scripts` (the README claimed they
  were removed), the tool surface is 17 including `browser_launch` and
  `browser_describe_image` (said 15), the image section shares the interactive item
  budget rather than splitting the character budget, the vision default is
  `deepseek-flash` (one example showed `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, the display name the
  code says returns 400), and a dozen file paths pointed at modules that do not
  exist in this tree.
- **Two capabilities the tool schema promised were implemented rather than
  retracted.** `browser_type` advertised filling a `<select>` and setting a
  checkbox/radio, and `browser_wait` advertised `selector`/`text` conditions that
  fail with `timeout` — the executor did neither: a `<select>` was rejected as "not
  editable", a checkbox was written through the text `.value` path, and a wait
  condition was silently ignored so the model got a success for something that
  never happened. Both now work (`content/actions.ts`) and are pinned by
  `extension/tests/actions-form-controls.spec.ts`. A schema that promises behaviour
  is a bug report against the executor.
- **The temporary connection trace was removed** (`dshBridgeTraceProbe`). It was
  marked "Remove before publishing" and still wrote a rolling 120-line log into
  `chrome.storage.local` on every discovery attempt.
- **Launch resolves the extension directory only if it holds a `manifest.json`.**
  An unrelated `extension/dist` above an installed package would have been passed
  to `--load-extension`, and Chrome refuses to start over a bad path.
- **Two prompt constants are now asserted instead of described.** The system-prompt
  halves are exported (`BROWSER_PROMPT_PREAMBLE` / `BROWSER_PROMPT_MARKER_RULE`)
  and `packages/bridge/tests/index.spec.ts` fails if either grows a non-ASCII
  character or starts quoting the panel marker itself — the anti-impersonation
  invariant that previously rested on a comment.
- **`extension/package.json` declared Node `^22.19 || >=24`** while the root, the
  bridge and the README said `>=20`; they agree now (the protocol package declares
  no `engines`, being a private workspace package with no scripts to run).

### Changed

- **Version 0.38.0 across the tree**, asserted by `extension/tests/versions.spec.ts`
  so the four copies cannot drift again.
- **The workspace gained `benchmark/` as a member**, so its one devDependency
  (`playwright-core`, used to run the baseline browser and now the e2e's Chromium)
  installs with the same `pnpm install` as everything else. `check.yml` also runs
  the benchmark's own unit tests and the packaging step, and no longer points the
  e2e at `/usr/bin/google-chrome`.
- **`config/` is now a sanitized template.** The three desktop-config backups had
  this machine's absolute paths and its real workspace/session ids in them; they
  are placeholders now, with the convention documented in
  `config/README-what-these-are-and-how-to-restore.md`.
- **The packaged signing key and both committed archives were removed**
  (`extension/dist.pem`, `extension/dist.crx`, and the two 0.37.1 zips, which no
  longer matched the tree). Archives are built on demand, not shipped in the
  source.
- **The bundled troubleshooting skill was repaired**: its `name` now matches its
  directory, and its paths point at `packages/bridge` rather than the pre-0.37
  layout.
- **`browser_launch` validated the page it was told to open.** The value becomes an
  argument in the browser's argv, so `--headless` or `--load-extension=…` was read by
  the browser as a switch rather than as a page. Only an absolute `http:`/`https:`
  address is passed through now (`isWebUrl`/`webUrlOrUndefined`), on both the launch
  and the argument-building side, and a padded address is trimmed.
- **Turning unrestricted browser control off could fail to persist.** The revocation
  barrier awaits each in-flight call's `settled` promise, but `cancelAllToolCalls`
  emptied the map without resolving them, so a disconnect inside the window left the
  barrier waiting forever and the restrictive setting was never written — the safety
  switch silently not applying. Cancellation now settles every call, and the
  in-memory flag is cleared *before* the barrier so a call arriving during it cannot
  still capture the grant.
- **A superseded `session.create` could resurrect itself.** The fresh-session id was
  written to storage unconditionally, so a create that lost the race re-bound the
  panel to a conversation the user had just switched away from; it is now written
  only while its generation is current.
- **`detach` preserved the wrong rows.** A tool step row carries the id of the
  activity row it belongs to (`callId`), not its own, so matching on `id` dropped
  exactly the in-flight rows the parameter existed to keep.
- **`browser_type` reported success for changes that did not happen.** A disabled
  checkbox/radio accepted no click, and a checked radio cannot be unchecked, yet both
  answered "Checked/Unchecked". Disabled controls and the radio case are refused, and
  the state is verified after the click.
- **`browser_wait` text matching and budget.** The needle is whitespace-collapsed like
  `pageText` (a multi-line label could never match), the budget is clamped
  (`WAIT_MAX_BUDGET_MS`, since `1e999` parses to Infinity), and the default condition
  timeout is 10s rather than 15s because a cancelled call cannot interrupt the
  content-script poll.
- **A cancelled image recognition still hit the network.** `DirectRecognizer` lacked
  the `signal.aborted` pre-check that `BridgeRecognizer` had, so a request whose
  caller had already given up was sent anyway.
- **`browser_describe_image` coerced its arguments.** `Number(null)` is 0, so
  `index: null` described the first image; a bad `frame` silently became frame 0.
  Both are refused now, like the tool-dispatch path already did.
- **Snapshot baselines were never pruned** when a tab closed — one entry per tab ever
  snapshotted, for the life of the worker.
- **`pnpm run build` could not work on Node 24 + Windows at all.** `scripts/build.mjs`
  spawned `vite.cmd`, which returns `EINVAL` without a shell (and `shell: true` with an
  argument list is deprecated as DEP0190), and a failed spawn reported nothing, so the
  build exited 1 with no output. Vite is now run through `process.execPath` with its
  JavaScript entry point, and a failed spawn prints why.

### Known

- The 0.37 note below claimed a test asserted "exactly one WebSocket". That is no
  longer true: `background-session.spec.ts` asserts `toBeGreaterThan(0)` with the
  comment "At least one, not exactly one: … a test that counts dials fails for a
  legitimate retry". The assertion was relaxed, so the flakiness it described is
  gone and this entry is kept only to correct the record.
- **Nothing restores in-flight state across an MV3 worker restart.** Pending
  approvals, session grants and snapshot baselines live in memory only, so if the
  worker is stopped while a tool call waits on an approval (up to 120 s) the call is
  never answered and its panel card is gone. Conversations are unaffected — they are
  owned by the desktop side — but the model's call times out rather than resuming.
  Persisting approvals would mean persisting a decision the user has not made yet,
  which is worse than the timeout, so this is listed as a boundary rather than a bug.
- `approvalNotifications` remains a stored setting that the notification path
  bypasses by design (the panel is the notification surface when it is closed), and
  `visionThinking`/`visionTimeoutMs` exist only in the desktop plugin config, not in
  the extension's `Settings`. Both are deliberate; they are listed so a reader
  comparing the settings sheet with the storage schema does not read the difference
  as drift.

## [0.37]

A rewrite rather than a patch release. The packages were renamed and re-cut, so the
paths in the previous entry no longer describe this tree; both layouts are described
in the README.

### Added

- **Images can be read, when the user asks.** The model could describe a page but not
  a picture on it, which is what a product page, a chart or a screenshot of an error
  often is. The desktop now relays the image to the model the user configured, with
  four tiers — off, low, standard, enhanced — and **off by default**: nothing is
  fetched and nothing is sent until the user turns it on, and the panel's help text
  says why the recommendation is to leave it off, including what a look costs.
- **A benchmark that measures instead of describing.** Six tasks covering the shapes a
  browser agent meets (read, single action, form, search, multi-step, dynamic), run
  against a fixture site with seeded variation, comparing this extension with the
  runner's Playwright baseline on the same model and machine: success rate, completion
  time, tool calls and prompt tokens per task. Speed claims about a browser backend are
  only meaningful as a paired comparison, because the model dominates absolute time.
- **Continuous integration**, on the same steps a release uses: a frozen-lockfile
  install, a forced typecheck, the tests, and both extension targets. The build runs
  before the tests so that the two checks which skip without a build actually run.

### Changed

- **The layout.** `packages/browser/bridge-browser/` became `packages/bridge/`,
  `extensions/dsh-browser/` became `extension/`, and the wire contract moved into its
  own package, `packages/protocol/`.
- **The extension's network policy.** Its content security policy allowed loopback
  only, which meant the worker's own image fetch could never reach a real host: the
  desktop had to fetch instead, and the desktop cannot carry the user's cookies, so an
  image behind a login was unreadable. `connect-src` now also allows `https:` and
  `http:` for that one operation, and the store's permission justification says so,
  because a reviewer reads it next to the manifest.
- **One version across the tree.** The root, the protocol, the bridge and the extension
  all carry 0.37, so a plugin list, a manifest and a tag cannot disagree.

### Fixed

- **A store-listing assertion had been skipping itself.** It resolves the repository
  root two levels up; the path arithmetic taken from upstream was three, so it pointed
  above the repository and the check that the listing and `_locales/en` agree had
  never run. It runs, and it passes.
- **Asking about an image twice downloaded it twice.** The bytes were fetched before
  the cache was consulted — invisible while the policy refused every real host, and a
  real download per repeat once it did not.
- **`cancelPendingWork()` cleared a timer but not the dialing.** A client that was
  reconnecting opened a socket after the teardown meant to end it, and a `startBridge`
  already in flight created a fresh client. Cancellation now abandons that start and
  stops the client.

### Known

- One test in `background-session.spec.ts` was described here as asserting that
  exactly one WebSocket was opened, with the worker free to dial twice under load.
  The assertion was subsequently relaxed to "at least one" — see the 0.38 entry,
  which corrects this note. The dead `approvalNotifications` setting and the
  desktop-only `visionThinking`/`visionTimeoutMs` keys are likewise covered by the
  0.38 entry rather than repeated here.
