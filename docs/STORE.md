# Submitting to a browser extension store

The groundwork for a store submission, and the two things that actually reject an
upload. Read this before opening a dashboard; the copy to paste is in
`store-assets/`.

## 1. Build the archive a store will accept

```sh
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build                   # Chrome → dist/
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:firefox           # Firefox → dist-firefox/
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:store             # Chrome → dist-store/
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run build:store:firefox     # Firefox → dist-firefox-store/
pnpm --filter dsh-browser-extension run package                 # writes the zips into the repo root
```

The first two are not optional even though the `-store` builds are what you upload: the
packaging script reads the version out of `dist/manifest.json` **and**
`dist-firefox/manifest.json` and refuses to run if either is missing, and it always writes the
two development archives alongside the store pair.

That produces four archives, and **the name says which one to upload**:

| Archive | Manifest `key` | Upload to |
|---|---|---|
| `dsh-browser-crossplatform-<version>-store.zip` | absent | **Chrome Web Store** |
| `dsh-browser-crossplatform-<version>-store-firefox.zip` | absent | **Firefox AMO** |
| `dsh-browser-crossplatform-<version>.zip` | present | nobody — load unpacked in a development browser |
| `dsh-browser-crossplatform-<version>-firefox.zip` | absent | nobody — Firefox dev build |

### Why the `key` has to go

The repository's manifests carry a `key` (an RSA public key). It pins the
extension id: the id is derived from it, which is why every development install
gets the same id (`kdhkdgfcinfkmogifamoapmheihhcjfk`) and why the bridge can
recognise the extension on its token-free loopback path.

A store refuses it. The Chrome Web Store's own wording, on the upload screen:

> 清单文件中不得包含"key"字段。

So the `--store` builds drop the field and nothing else. The store then assigns
the id itself.

### The consequence to expect

**A store install presents an id the development build never had.** The bridge's
token-free path names the ids it trusts in `extensionId`, and as of 0.38.4 that
default lists both `DEFAULT_EXTENSION_IDS` entries in
`packages/bridge/src/index.ts`: the development id the manifest `key` derives
(`kdhkdgfcinfkmogifamoapmheihhcjfk`), and the id the Chrome Web Store assigned
(`agipnijjkpomaannkjkjliggoffdiaf`). A store install therefore connects with no
configuration.

Both are named on purpose, and one is not a fallback for the other: the store
refuses a manifest carrying `key`, so the two builds genuinely present different
origins and both must be accepted for "install it and it works" to hold either way.

If you ever ship under a third id — a different store, a different signing key —
add it there, comma-separated, or point `extensionId` at your own list. Until it is
listed, that build's user can set the token from `~/.dsh/ext-bridge-token` in the
extension's own storage — the same route the Firefox path already requires, since the
panel has no field for it. `docs/INSTALL.md` carries the console snippet.

## 2. Fill in the listing

Copy-paste source for every field: `store-assets/store-listing.md` (name, short
description, detailed description), `store-assets/submission-form-field-by-field.md`
(field-by-field, including the URLs) and
`store-assets/permission-and-data-disclosure.md` (the per-permission argument).

Three things that are easy to get wrong:

- **The name must match `_locales`.** The manifest carries `__MSG_extensionName__`,
  so the store shows whatever the locale files say; a listing name typed by hand
  can disagree with the installed extension.
- **The short description is asserted equal to `_locales/en`** by
  `extension/tests/locales.spec.ts`, and the store's limit is 132 characters. Copy
  it from `store-listing.md` rather than retyping it.
- **Firefox declares more than Chrome.** `manifest.firefox.json` declares four
  `data_collection_permissions`; the AMO form must repeat all four. Copying Chrome's
  single tick across is what gets a submission bounced.

## 3. Data practices

Tick **only** "website content" in Chrome's form; see
`store-assets/permission-and-data-disclosure.md` for the reasoning and the exact
wording. The privacy policy URL must serve the **current** `PRIVACY.md` — the
form points at a gist, and a gist that still says "the extension fetches the
image" without the direct-endpoint path is a disclosure that no longer matches the
code.

## 4. Screenshots

1–5 images at 1280×800 or 640×400, captured from a real session. They are not in
this repository: the dashboard wants the upload, and a committed screenshot goes
stale silently. Worth showing, in this order: the task list mid-run, a page read
as the numbered inventory, an approval card, and an image description.
