# Copyright and licensing

This project is a derivative work. Two sets of rights apply, and this file says
which is which so nobody has to guess.

## Upstream: the browser engine

The following come from the upstream browser engine and remain under its MIT license:

- `packages/bridge/` — the bridge plugin
- `extension/src/content/` — the page snapshot and action pipeline
- `extension/src/security/` — the approval and trust model
- `extension/src/background/` — except `session.ts`
- `benchmark/` — the evaluation harness

**Which repository that is, exactly.** The fork point was
[`Lum1104/dsh-browser`](https://github.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser), which has since been
renamed and transferred to **`omdsh-dev/dsh-browser`**; the old URL still resolves by
redirect. The original name is kept here because it is the historical record of where
this code was received from, and `omdsh-dev/dsh-browser` is the current location of the
same project — not a different one.

**The paths above are this fork's, and the layout differs.** Upstream keeps the bridge at
`packages/browser/bridge-browser/` and the extension at `extensions/dsh-browser/`; this
fork flattened both (`packages/bridge/`, `extension/`). Every file in the five groups
above was checked against the current upstream tree: all five exist there. A file being
in one of these groups means **the file originates upstream**, not that it is still
byte-identical — this fork has since modified some of them heavily, which is what the
MIT notice permits and what the next section delimits.

At the fork point these were 78 byte-identical files and about 90% of upstream's
lines, which is why the notice below has to be preserved. That is a condition of
the license the code was received under, not a courtesy.

## This fork: the interaction layer

Copyright (c) 2026 youbaiyun. Also MIT, on the same terms as above.

The files this fork is responsible for, none of which come from upstream:

- `extension/control/` — the side-panel UI, dependency-free vanilla TypeScript (replaces the upstream panel)
- `extension/src/settings.ts` — the settings model
- `extension/src/markers.ts` — the browser-panel prompt marker (replaces upstream's
  `selection.ts`, away from the *selection* concept and towards an origin marker)
- `extension/src/background/session.ts` — panel-to-conversation binding
- `skills/dsh-browser-crossplatform-troubleshooting/` — the troubleshooting skill
- the panel's own tests (`extension/tests/`), and the build/packaging scripts under
  `extension/scripts/` (`build.mjs`, `package.mjs`, `extension-id.mjs`)

### Same, and different

Stated plainly, because "derivative" can mean anything from a rename to a rewrite:

| | Upstream | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared** | the browser engine: content-script snapshot and action pipeline, the approval/trust model, the bridge transport, the benchmark harness | the same code, still under upstream's MIT notice |
| **Shared** | tool surface of `browser_*`, side-panel concept, MV3 + Firefox dual build, `--load-extension`-free operation | same architecture, extended rather than replaced |
| **Different** | the panel as upstream ships it (`panel/`, plus panel sources under `src/panel/`) | a dependency-free vanilla-TS panel under `control/`; no framework, no build-time UI dependency |
| **Different** | `selection.ts` (selection-based prompt handling) | `markers.ts` (an origin marker the model can check mechanically) |
| **Different** | one version number per package | one version number across five packages (root, protocol, bridge, extension, benchmark), asserted by a test |
| **Different** | bridge = `packages/browser/bridge-browser/`, extension = `extensions/dsh-browser/` | `packages/bridge/`, `extension/` |
| **Different** | ships no settings model of its own; panel owns almost no policy | `extension/src/settings.ts` owns the choices, and the panel only renders what it is handed |
| **Added here** | — | `session.follow` / `session.unfollow`, whole-workspace mirroring, `browser_launch`, image recognition relay, the troubleshooting skill, and the plugin settings page |

## Removed on purpose

`.github/FUNDING.yml` was deleted. It named the upstream maintainer's sponsorship
account, which would have collected donations intended for this fork.

## Contributions upstream

Engine defects belong in the upstream issue tracker, because the code in question
is theirs. Panel and interaction defects belong here.
